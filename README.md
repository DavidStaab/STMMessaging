# Simple Messaging (STM)
STM is a thin protocol definition on top of a transport layer to simplify the process of sending and receiving various messages and data packets between different systems in an application

###The LabVIEW version used for STM is 2010. Please ensure that all pull requests use 2010. If you do not have 2010, be sure to use features supported in 2010 -- that is, don't use auto-indexing, async call by ref, or any other features added in the last few years.
