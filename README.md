# Simple Messaging (STM)
STM is a thin protocol definition on top of a transport layer to simplify the process of sending and receiving various messages and data packets between different systems in an application

This repo is a fork used to submit pull requests for bug fixes and "improvements" to the project itself.

###The LabVIEW version used for STM is 2010. Please ensure that all pull requests use 2010. If you do not have 2010, be sure to use features supported in 2010, including:
* auto-building arrays on FOR loops
* async call by ref (ACBR node)
